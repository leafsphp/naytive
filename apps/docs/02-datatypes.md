# Naytive Data Types

Since Naytive is built to be a low-level language, it has all the basic data types that you would expect from a language like C/C++. These data types are used to represent different kinds of values, such as numbers, characters, and pointers. For simplicity, Naytive also supports TypeScript's built-in data types, such as `string`, `number`, and `boolean`, which can be used interchangeably with Naytive's data types.

## Basic Data Types

Here are the basic data types that Naytive supports:

- `char`: A single character/letter/number, or ASCII values.
- `string`: A sequence of characters.
- `bool` or `boolean`: A boolean value, either `true` or `false`.
- `int`: A whole number, without decimals.
- `float`: A fractional number, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 6-7 decimal digits.
- `double`: A fractional number, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits.
- `number`: A number, which can be either an `int`, `float`, or `double`.

These are the basic data types that you will be using most often in Naytive, but Naytive also supports C data types like `short`, `long`, `longlong`, `uint`, and `longdouble`. These data types are used to represent different sizes and signedness of integers, and are useful when working with low-level code.
