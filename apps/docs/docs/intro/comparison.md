# Naytive vs XXX

Over the years, many languages have been developed to solve the problems that C/C++ have. Some of these languages have been successful, while others have not. In this section, we'll take a look at some of the most popular languages that are used for system-intense work and compare them to Naytive.

## Rust

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but has many features that make it a great language for system-intense work, such as:

- **Memory Safety**: Rust has built-in safety features that prevent common bugs like buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, and memory leaks. This makes Rust code more reliable and secure than C/C++ code.

- **Concurrency**: Rust has built-in support for concurrency, which means that you can write code that runs in parallel without having to worry about

- **Performance**: Rust is designed to be fast and memory-efficient, which means that you can write code that runs quickly and uses as little memory as possible.

- **Modern Features**: Rust has many modern features like pattern matching, type inference, and generics that make your code more readable and maintainable.

- **Cargo**: Rust has a package manager called Cargo that makes it easy to manage dependencies and build projects. Cargo is designed to be fast and reliable, so you can spend less time managing your project and more time writing code.

Rust is a great language for system-intense work, and is the closest thing to Naytive in terms of features and capabilities. However, to the modern developer, Rust has a steeper learning curve compared to other languages, and can be difficult to learn and apply on the fly. Rust also has a different syntax and programming model than C/C++, which can make it hard to migrate existing codebases to Rust. Naytive gives you the best of both worlds: the high-level features of TypeScript and the low-level capabilities of C/C++, without additional complexities and steep learning curves.

## Zig

[Zig](https://ziglang.org/) is a systems programming language that is designed to be simple, efficient, and safe. It is a modern language that is designed to be fast, memory-efficient, and easy to use. Zig has many features that make it a great language for system-intense work, such as:

- **Safety**: Zig has built-in safety features that prevent common bugs like buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, and memory leaks. This makes Zig code more reliable and secure than C/C++ code.

- **Performance**: Zig is designed to be fast and memory-efficient, which means that you can write code that runs quickly and uses as little memory as possible.

- **Modern Features**: Zig has many modern features like comptime, error handling, and generics that make your code more readable and maintainable.

- **Self-contained**: Zig is designed to be self-contained, which means that you can write code that is easy to understand and maintain. Zig has a small standard library that is designed to be simple and efficient, so you can focus on writing code that solves your problem.

Zig is a great choice for both low-level and high-level work, however, it is still a relatively new language and has a smaller community compared to other languages like Rust and C/C++. Zig also has fewer learning resources and tools compared to other languages, which can make it difficult to learn and apply on the fly. Compared to Zig, the majority of Naytive is designed to be as close to TypeScript as possible, which has a larger community and more learning resources, making it easier to learn and apply on the fly.

***Unlike the languages mentioned above, Naytive itself is not a language, but a bridge that connects TypeScript to C/C++.***

In terms of performance, Naytive is highly memory-optimized C++ code which means Naytive performance metrics are C++ performance metrics.
