# Type Casting

Type casting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. This can be useful when you need to work with a value in a different data type than the one it is currently in.

Type casting in TypeScript is done using the `as` keyword. Here is an example of type casting:

```typescript
const value: any = '123';

// Cast the value to a number
const numberValue = value as number;

console.log(numberValue); // Output: 123
```

In this example, the `value` variable is cast to a number using the `as` keyword. The `numberValue` variable now contains the value `123` as a number.

Type casting can also be done with more complex data types, such as structs. Here is an example of type casting an object:

```typescript
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

const person: any = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 30,
};

// Cast the person object to the Person type
const typedPerson = person as Person;

console.log(typedPerson.name); // Output: Alice
console.log(typedPerson.age); // Output: 30
```

In this example, the `person` object is cast to the `Person` type using the `as` keyword. The `typedPerson` variable now contains the `person` object with the correct type.

Type casting can be a powerful tool when working with Naytive, but it should be used carefully to avoid runtime errors. It is important to ensure that the value being cast is compatible with the target data type to avoid unexpected behavior.

```typescript
const value: any = '123';

// Cast the value to a boolean
const booleanValue = value as boolean;

console.log(booleanValue); // Error: Type 'string' and type 'boolean' have no overlap
```

In this example, the `value` variable is cast to a boolean, which is not compatible with the string value `'123'`. This will result in a runtime error when the code is executed.
