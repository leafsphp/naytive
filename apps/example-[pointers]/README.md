# Loops Example

This example is shows how to use loops in a Naytive application. As of now, only `for` and `forEach` loops are supported and can be used in the same way as in JavaScript. However, remember to add the types of the variables in the loop, as Naytive cannot directly infer the types of the variables.

## How to run

To run this example, simply install the dependencies and run the dev script:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
