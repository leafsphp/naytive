# TS Imports Example

This example demonstrates how to import TypeScript files in a Naytive project. Naytive allows you to directly import functions, classes, and other items from TypeScript files and use them in your Naytive code just as you would in a regular TypeScript project. This example imports an add function from a TypeScript file and uses it to add two numbers.

## How to run

To run this example, simply install the dependencies and run the dev script:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
