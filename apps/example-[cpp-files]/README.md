# Naytive + CPP Example

This example shows how to import and use C++ files in a Naytive project. Naytive allows you to directly import items from C++ files and use them in your TypeScript code using the same syntax as you would use for TypeScript files. Unfortunately, this is not a TypeScript language feature, so you will not get any type checking or intellisense for the imported items from C++ files (at least not yet).

## How to run

To run this example, simply install the dependencies and run the dev script:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
